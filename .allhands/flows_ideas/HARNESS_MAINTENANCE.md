Uses of the XML tag:

The XML tag must only be used to draw specific attention to rules. Its the framework for building agents and flows. 

* role_responsibilities: High level responsibilities of the agent.
* constraints: Hard rules (NEVER/MUST/ALWAYS) that the agent must follow.
* motivations: The motivations for having this agent. The bigger picture of what is contributes to.
* ownership: The files and domains that the agent is restricted to.
* success_criteria: The criteria to be validated for when the agent has completed its task.
* output_format: Describes how the agentic output should be formatted. Most use cases will require concise, to the point output.
