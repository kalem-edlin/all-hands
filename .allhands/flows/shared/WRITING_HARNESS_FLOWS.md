<goal>
Flow authoring conventions for the All Hands harness. Per **Knowledge Compounding**, comprehensive flow-writing knowledge is centralized in the harness-maintenance skill.
</goal>

## Start Here

- Run `ah skills search` to discover the `harness-maintenance` skill
- Read the skill's routing table — select `references/writing-flows.md` for flow authoring patterns
- For execution, follow `.allhands/flows/harness/WRITING_HARNESS_FLOWS.md`

Per **Context is Precious**, this file redirects to two canonical sources — the skill reference for domain knowledge, the harness flow for execution — rather than duplicating content.
