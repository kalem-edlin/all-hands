NOTES:
* inputs:
  * A specific query for the context7 usage or btca usage to address (since both handle queries)
  * An indiviation of if any queries involve open source git projects, or are proprietary domain with documentation pages only for reference of use
  * Any relevant files of this codebase that can be injected into teh query if the quwery is refering to these relevant files from the codebase.
* Used like the `./RESEARCH_GUIDANCE.md` flow, except for the use of either `ah context7` or `btca` command to figure out explicit documentation for external dependency technologies / using their core inner workings as inspiration to implementaiton
* Most cases allow this process to use BOTH tools in parallel as both can give decent well rounded perspective . Some cases however may only need valid docuemntation references (context7), or to disect an open source library for implementation inspiration (btca)
* Anything else that weould be beneficial to include here for guidance / optinionated practices for the agents to follow when doign external tech guidance
* outputs: 
  * A summary of the guidance, and a summary of exactly what guidance was provided for the query.
  * Strong implementaiton examples / suggestions infered from the answers provided by the tools.
