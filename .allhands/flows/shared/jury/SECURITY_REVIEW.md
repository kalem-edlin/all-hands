NOTES:
* inputs: Alignment doc path, prompts folder path
* uses git (diff to base) to asses the milestone implementation to ensure it is secure and does not introduce any security risks
* Read the alignment doc to see if there were any security specific decisions made that need to be considered here.
* Focuses on networking and other cyber secutiry risks that the planning phase may have missed.
* returns the review results, and a summary of exactly what implementation violates the security principles ordered by priority for fixing.
