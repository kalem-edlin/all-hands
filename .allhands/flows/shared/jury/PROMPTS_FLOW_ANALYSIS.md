NOTES:
* inputs: Alignment doc path, prompts folder path
* Logically works through the interdepednecies of prompts, and thinks about what the merge control / setup / tear down risks are for prompts that Could theoretically be run in parallel due to the dependency structures.
* Tries to optimize and review the ordering / building of prompts from the perspective of a tech lead engineer who needs to DERISK the most important logic first to produce results that give the greatest amount of confidence in the reality of the outcome at the earliest possible times. The concept is classifc to startups that need to move fast and prioritize resources for the most importnat work. Doing the most improtant things that reveal the most about the stability  / feasiblity of the implementation to solve the alignment doc goals and user expecataons as easly as possible is very imporatnt and signalling if these may fail early by the ordering / prompts flow is going to be significant.
* Looks into how prompts could be reordered / redistributed to maximmze effectiveness in iteration by allowing for omptimal parallelization opporuntiies balanced with the pricniples of derisking as soon as possible.
* Returns the review results, and a summary of exactly what implementation violates the flow analysis principles and how the prompt ordering / content of prompts / distrbution of tasking can ordered by priority for fixing.
