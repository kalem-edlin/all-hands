# Flows

Workflow definitions that guide agents through tasks. Flows follow a lifecycle from ideation through execution to knowledge compounding.

| Pre-execution | Plan review jury | [ref:docs/flows/plan-review-jury.md] |
| Research | Plan deepening and research | [ref:docs/flows/plan-deepening-and-research.md] |
| Execution | Prompt task execution | [ref:docs/flows/prompt-task-execution.md] |
